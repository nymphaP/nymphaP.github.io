            <p class="omg">I would personally love to go to NYU. However, I have to worry about getting into the school to begin with, and then the price, and where I would live. I would not like to be in student debt before I even get employed, you know? Plus, I've been to NYC before, and it smells like weed.

            However, the thing that I like about NYC the most is how eventful the city is and how there's always something to do. 
            </p>
            <p class="omg">In conclusion, if I really want to go to NYU, I need to focus on my grades, and then my SAT and ACT scores. I heard that NYU is more academic based, so I really hope they don't take my (lack of) extracurriculars into account.</p>
            <p class="omg">If NYU doesn't work out, I'm probably going to UW (Univeresity of Washington) with my friend. And if I get rejected from both schools, I'll attend UH.</p>
