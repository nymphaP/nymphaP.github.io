            <dt>Crochet</dt>
            <dd>I'll be honest, I haven't crocheted since last year, but the last thing I made was a bouquet of flowers. I also crocheted a scarf and my dad's beanie for when we took a trip to New York. </dd>
            <dt>Reading</dt>
            <dd>My record for reading books was 5 fantasy books [so around 400 pages each] in 2 weeks. Last summer, I read 7 books in total. However, now I have another  books that is rotting up on my shelf, that I never got to because of my AP assignments.</dd>
            <dt>Writing</dt>
            <dd>Sometimes I just think too much, and I need somewhere to place my genius ideas. So I write a lot. I think my record for writing was three handwritten pages in 30 minutes. I mostly write about my ambitions, but I think I should start writing stories.</dd>
            <dt>Watching movies</dt>
            <dd>I love watching horror movies, just for the adrenaline, but I also like older romcoms.</dd>
            <dt>Edits</dt>
            <dd>I'll be honest, I make edits. I have yet to make a thirst trap edit, but my friend wants me to.</dd>
