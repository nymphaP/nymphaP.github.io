            <ul>
                <li>Crocheting</li>
                    <ul>Crocheting is important to me because my imagination is pretty powerful. So, I can imagine a piece of clothing, that unfortunately no one of thought of creating yet. So instead of waiting for it to be created, I can make it myself. Plus it sounds really cool when I tell someone I can crochet.</ul>
                <li>Watching Movies / Reading Books</li>
                    <ul>I love the story telling aspect of a movie and reading books. It is important for me because it allows further creative thinking in my brain. And plus have you ever finished reading a book or watching a movie and it physically hurts because the plot twist was extremely unexpected, or the storyline was perfect?</ul>
                <li>Learning</li>
                    <ul>I like learning new skills and interesting facts so that they could be brought up in conversations. I also enjoy being more knowledgeable than other people.</ul>
                <li>Playing Darts</li>
                    <ul>I haven't played darts in a long time, but it is still important to me because my dad and I used to play it everyday during the summer. I remember during the summer, my dad was really good at playing darts, and my only goal was to beat him with bullseyes.</ul>
                <li>Editing</li>
                    <ul>Like I've mentioned, my imagination is pretty powerful and I watch a lot of movies. So whenever I scroll through TikTok, sometimes I think "this would be such a good edit idea." Now that I can edit, I can just create whatever I want, whenever I want.</ul>
